# Multi-Agent
This project builds an end-to-end research automation pipeline that transforms raw scientific literature into structured, high-quality academic reports. It integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector database search, multi-agent collaboration, and LoRA fine-tuning, ensuring both scientific rigor and domain-specific adaptability.
